This is the first project of my journey of learning how to become a web developer.
This project is to create a website that has a list of recipes.
Throughout this project I have showed that I know how to get text, headers, links, lists, and images onto a webpage. I have also started to become familial with git and the command line.
I have now started to learn how to use css, selectors, etc...
